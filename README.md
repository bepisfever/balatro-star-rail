# Mod Description
- This mod strives to bring in what makes Honkai: Star Rail so addictive to begin with: Stats, Synergies, Relics, and of course, **Gacha**.
- It's mostly a standalone mod due to how many features it brings. I try my best to balance everything in here out, so if you have any
feedback, feel free to directly contact me!

# Features
## Familiar faces as Jokers!
Characters from Honkai Star Rail are now added as Jokers, and they will certainly be very useful in helping you earn as much Score as possible.
Their rarities can vary from 3-Star, 4-Star, and 5-Star, though 3-Star only consists of... a trash bag. Surely, *no one* likes that.

## Introducing: Relics!
You may notice that the casino will tend to be rather... weird, sometimes.
Fret not, it is all but a side-effect from possessing such a valuable tool!
We HIGHLY suggest you remain calm and patient at all times.

## Introducing: Gacha!
A new section now appears at the top right of the screen when you enter a Shop.
That's right - a newly implemented Gacha system for getting Jokers from this mod.

    <summary><b>Additional Notes</b></summary>
    This version of the mod is currently in its Playtest phase, so it currently lacks a LOT of intended features. I decided to release this early to 
    see if the overall concept of my mod is fun to play with, in order to make changes in time.

    ...also, I'm incapable of drawing so you will have to stick with Warp Tickets as placeholder art for the Jokers right now.
    ...and uh, didn't make custom rarities, yet, sorry if souls give you a 5-Star Joker :3
